      <h2>Company Overview</h2>

      <p>The LiquidTalent ("LT") marketplace provides a platform for professionals to connect in real-time, based on
        location. LiquidTalent users are encouraged to market their skills and abilities, interact with new professional
        contacts, engage with interested hiring sources, and earn financial capital. LT adds a new dimension to the
        economy by presenting users with real-time, income-earning opportunities based on skills, availability, and
        geographic location. Today, online reputations play an integral role in determining professional credibility.
        LiquidTalent actively demonstrates this credibility through authentic, comprehensive, and professionally-forward
        profiles.</p>

      <p>Through a mobile application, LiquidTalent helps organizations, small-businesses, and individuals discover
        talent based on relevant search criteria including skills, experience, education, hourly rate, reviews and
        ratings. Talent is hired on a per project basis and search results are displayed in the format of both a List
        and a Map. The List showcases talent through a 22 second video and a personal description of up to 160
        characters. The Map displays the physical location of talent in relation to the user. LiquidTalent is your
        career in your pocket, a never before seen on-the-go professional platform that increases earning potential.
        LiquidTalent is establishing a new paradigm of professional connection and project execution.</p>

      <h2>The LiquidTalent Product</h2>

      <p>LiquidTalent's product acts as a piece of professional digital real estate, creating a space to showcase talent
        and build a sales pipeline. LT's beta application will initially launch on the iOS7 mobile marketplace. †Future
        product releases include an Android app and a fully functioning website designed for desktop, tablet and mobile
        phones. During the account-creation process users can log-in with LinkedIn profiles, thus validating talent and
        making registration quick and easy. LiquidTalent profiles will display users' skills, experience, education,
        hourly rate, reviews and ratings. The platform offers internal messaging, a function to save favorite talent, a
        seamless process for billing and executing legal contracts. The product will also feature LiquidPitch, a
        22-second elevator pitch explaining the what and why behind each user. With the proliferation of online video,
        professionals are becoming increasingly accustomed to marketing themselves through this rich format.</p>

      <h2>Company Overview</h2>

      <p>The LiquidTalent ("LT") marketplace provides a platform for professionals to connect in real-time, based on
        location. LiquidTalent users are encouraged to market their skills and abilities, interact with new professional
        contacts, engage with interested hiring sources, and earn financial capital. LT adds a new dimension to the
        economy by presenting users with real-time, income-earning opportunities based on skills, availability, and
        geographic location. Today, online reputations play an integral role in determining professional credibility.
        LiquidTalent actively demonstrates this credibility through authentic, comprehensive, and professionally-forward
        profiles.</p>

      <p>Through a mobile application, LiquidTalent helps organizations, small-businesses, and individuals discover
        talent based on relevant search criteria including skills, experience, education, hourly rate, reviews and
        ratings. Talent is hired on a per project basis and search results are displayed in the format of both a List
        and a Map. The List showcases talent through a 22 second video and a personal description of up to 160
        characters. The Map displays the physical location of talent in relation to the user. LiquidTalent is your
        career in your pocket, a never before seen on-the-go professional platform that increases earning potential.
        LiquidTalent is establishing a new paradigm of professional connection and project execution.</p>

      <h2>The LiquidTalent Product</h2>

      <p>LiquidTalent's product acts as a piece of professional digital real estate, creating a space to showcase talent
        and build a sales pipeline. LT's beta application will initially launch on the iOS7 mobile marketplace. †Future
        product releases include an Android app and a fully functioning website designed for desktop, tablet and mobile
        phones. During the account-creation process users can log-in with LinkedIn profiles, thus validating talent and
        making registration quick and easy. LiquidTalent profiles will display users' skills, experience, education,
        hourly rate, reviews and ratings. The platform offers internal messaging, a function to save favorite talent, a
        seamless process for billing and executing legal contracts. The product will also feature LiquidPitch, a
        22-second elevator pitch explaining the what and why behind each user. With the proliferation of online video,
        professionals are becoming increasingly accustomed to marketing themselves through this rich format.</p>

      <h2>Company Overview</h2>

      <p>The LiquidTalent ("LT") marketplace provides a platform for professionals to connect in real-time, based on
        location. LiquidTalent users are encouraged to market their skills and abilities, interact with new professional
        contacts, engage with interested hiring sources, and earn financial capital. LT adds a new dimension to the
        economy by presenting users with real-time, income-earning opportunities based on skills, availability, and
        geographic location. Today, online reputations play an integral role in determining professional credibility.
        LiquidTalent actively demonstrates this credibility through authentic, comprehensive, and professionally-forward
        profiles.</p>

      <p>Through a mobile application, LiquidTalent helps organizations, small-businesses, and individuals discover
        talent based on relevant search criteria including skills, experience, education, hourly rate, reviews and
        ratings. Talent is hired on a per project basis and search results are displayed in the format of both a List
        and a Map. The List showcases talent through a 22 second video and a personal description of up to 160
        characters. The Map displays the physical location of talent in relation to the user. LiquidTalent is your
        career in your pocket, a never before seen on-the-go professional platform that increases earning potential.
        LiquidTalent is establishing a new paradigm of professional connection and project execution.</p>

      <h2>The LiquidTalent Product</h2>

      <p>LiquidTalent\'s product acts as a piece of professional digital real estate, creating a space to showcase talent
        and build a sales pipeline. LT\'s beta application will initially launch on the iOS7 mobile marketplace. †Future
        product releases include an Android app and a fully functioning website designed for desktop, tablet and mobile
        phones. During the account-creation process users can log-in with LinkedIn profiles, thus validating talent and
        making registration quick and easy. LiquidTalent profiles will display users\' skills, experience, education,
        hourly rate, reviews and ratings. The platform offers internal messaging, a function to save favorite talent, a
        seamless process for billing and executing legal contracts. The product will also feature LiquidPitch, a
        22-second elevator pitch explaining the what and why behind each user. With the proliferation of online video,

      <h2>Company Overview</h2>

      <p>The LiquidTalent ("LT") marketplace provides a platform for professionals to connect in real-time, based on
        location. LiquidTalent users are encouraged to market their skills and abilities, interact with new professional
        contacts, engage with interested hiring sources, and earn financial capital. LT adds a new dimension to the
        economy by presenting users with real-time, income-earning opportunities based on skills, availability, and
        geographic location. Today, online reputations play an integral role in determining professional credibility.
        LiquidTalent actively demonstrates this credibility through authentic, comprehensive, and professionally-forward
        profiles.</p>

      <p>Through a mobile application, LiquidTalent helps organizations, small-businesses, and individuals discover
        talent based on relevant search criteria including skills, experience, education, hourly rate, reviews and
        ratings. Talent is hired on a per project basis and search results are displayed in the format of both a List
        and a Map. The List showcases talent through a 22 second video and a personal description of up to 160
        characters. The Map displays the physical location of talent in relation to the user. LiquidTalent is your
        career in your pocket, a never before seen on-the-go professional platform that increases earning potential.
        LiquidTalent is establishing a new paradigm of professional connection and project execution.</p>

      <h2>The LiquidTalent Product</h2>

      <p>LiquidTalent\'s product acts as a piece of professional digital real estate, creating a space to showcase talent

      <h2>Company Overview</h2>

      <p>The LiquidTalent ("LT") marketplace provides a platform for professionals to connect in real-time, based on
        location. LiquidTalent users are encouraged to market their skills and abilities, interact with new professional
        contacts, engage with interested hiring sources, and earn financial capital. LT adds a new dimension to the
        economy by presenting users with real-time, income-earning opportunities based on skills, availability, and
        geographic location. Today, online reputations play an integral role in determining professional credibility.
        LiquidTalent actively demonstrates this credibility through authentic, comprehensive, and professionally-forward
        profiles.</p>

      <p>Through a mobile application, LiquidTalent helps organizations, small-businesses, and individuals discover
        talent based on relevant search criteria including skills, experience, education, hourly rate, reviews and
        ratings. Talent is hired on a per project basis and search results are displayed in the format of both a List
        and a Map. The List showcases talent through a 22 second video and a personal description of up to 160
        characters. The Map displays the physical location of talent in relation to the user. LiquidTalent is your
        career in your pocket, a never before seen on-the-go professional platform that increases earning potential.
        LiquidTalent is establishing a new paradigm of professional connection and project execution.</p>

      <h2>The LiquidTalent Product</h2>

      <p>LiquidTalent\'s product acts as a piece of professional digital real estate, creating a space to showcase talent
        and build a sales pipeline. LT\'s beta application will initially launch on the iOS7 mobile marketplace. †Future
        product releases include an Android app and a fully functioning website designed for desktop, tablet and mobile
        phones. During the account-creation process users can log-in with LinkedIn profiles, thus validating talent and
        making registration quick and easy. LiquidTalent profiles will display users\' skills, experience, education,
        hourly rate, reviews and ratings. The platform offers internal messaging, a function to save favorite talent, a
        seamless process for billing and executing legal contracts. The product will also feature LiquidPitch, a
        22-second elevator pitch explaining the what and why behind each user. With the proliferation of online video,
        professionals are becoming increasingly accustomed to marketing themselves through this rich format.</p>
